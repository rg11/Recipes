Start with the proportions of 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, 1 cup of lemon juice. 
Reduce the sugar amount if you are using Meyer lemons or if you like your lemonade less sweet. (I usually use 3/4 cup of lemon juice.)
Make the simple syrup
Combine with the lemon juice and Add more water (and ice) to dilute the lemonade to your taste.
