Lemonade

Ingredients:
1 cup of sugar
1 cup of water
1 cup of lemon juice

Method:

Reduce the sugar amount if you are using Meyer lemons or if you like your lemonade less sweet. (I usually use 3/4 cup of lemon juice.)
Make the simple syrup
Combine with the lemon juice
Add more water (and ice) to dilute the lemonade to your taste.
